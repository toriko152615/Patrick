You are required to review and confirm that all the information you provide, including the amounts, delivery details, personal details, payment information, and voucher codes (if applicable) is true, accurate and complete before you click “PLACE ORDER”. An Order is successfully placed when you receive an email confirmation containing your Order receipt from us.<br>

6.8 Cancelling an Order<br>

Please contact us immediately via our in-app customer support chat feature if you wish to cancel your Order after it has been placed. You have the right to cancel your Order provided a Vendor has not yet accepted your Order.<br>

(i) Cancelling Online Payment Orders<br>

You have the right to a refund for a cancelled Order only if a Vendor has not yet accepted your Order. Should you still decide to cancel your Order after it has been accepted by the Vendor, you understand that no refunds (whether in whole or in part) will be issued to you and you forfeit the delivery of your cancelled Order.
(ii) Cancelling Cash on Delivery (“COD”) Orders<br>

You have the right to cancel your Order only if a Vendor has not yet accepted your Order. Should you still decide to cancel your Order after it has been accepted by the Vendor, you understand that you shall forfeit the delivery of your cancelled Order and COD may be removed from your list of available payment methods for your future orders.<br>

<h2>21 Groceries / Convenience Shops</h2>

21.1 The purchase of Goods from Vendors on ‘SHOPS’ on the Platforms, including GNG (“SHOPS”) are subject to these Terms. Additionally, you agree to comply with any and all the guidelines, notices, operating rules and policies and instructions pertaining to the purchase of Goods from SHOPS which are incorporated into and form a part of these Terms.<br>

21.2 Due to delivery constraints, Grab N' Go may be required to impose a cap on the amount of your Order or limit the quantities of Goods in your Order from SHOPS in its sole discretion.<br>

21.3 Unless otherwise stated, all purchases from SHOPS shall be subject to the SHOPS cancellation, refund and returns policy.<br>
21.4 For Goods whose prices are determined based on weight, the actual weight of the Goods may be less or more than the weight that you have selected. Where you have placed an order for such Goods, you will only be charged an amount that is calculated based on the actual weight of the Goods purchased, if such actual weight is equal to or lower than the weight you have selected. The aforesaid is subject to the following:<br>

21.4.1 If you choose to pay by credit card (including paying by credit card through Google Pay or Apple Pay) or Gcash, you will be shown a pre-estimate of the price of these Goods (“Estimated Price”) at the checkout page. The invoice issued to you will reflect the Estimated Price of the Goods and you will be charged the Estimated Price. Separately, the Vendors shall update the order of the Goods to reflect the actual weight which may be equal to or lower than the weight you selected ("Actual Price”). This process will trigger the review of the price difference between the Estimated Price and Actual Price (“Price Difference”). If the actual weight of the Goods is lower than what you have selected, you will be given a refund for the Price Difference following Clause 6.9 above. If the actual weight of the Goods is more than what you have selected, such Goods will be removed from your order, and you will be notified via a pop-up on the Platform or by push notification that such Goods have been removed from your order. You will not be required to pay for such Goods whose weight exceed what you have selected, and you will be given a refund for the Estimated Price following Clause 6.9 above.<br>

21.4.2 If you choose COD, you will be shown the Estimated Price at the checkout page. Once the actual weight of the Goods has been confirmed, the price of the Goods will then be finalized if the actual weight of the Goods is equal to or lower than the weight you have selected (“Actual Price”). The Actual Price and weight of the Goods will then be reflected in the order tracking page and you will be notified via a pop-up on the Platform or by push notification if the price of the Goods has been reduced from the Estimated Price. The invoice issued to you will reflect the Actual Price of the Goods and you will only be charged the Actual Price of the Goods on delivery. If the weight of the Goods is more than what you have selected, such Goods will be removed from your order, and you will be notified via a pop-up on the Platform or by push notification that such Goods have been removed from your order. Such Goods whose weight exceeds what you have selected will not be delivered to you, and you will not be charged for such Goods. Where the prices of any Goods are subject to the definitive weight of the Goods, we will provide an initial estimate of the price for the purposes of checkout. The final price shall be indicated in your email confirmation containing your tax invoice. For shortfalls in payment, additional amounts shall be charged to you. For overpayments, excess amounts shall be refunded in accordance with our SHOPS cancellation, refund and returns policy.<br>

21.5 We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to restrict or limit the sales of our Goods to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction. Due to the laws in some countries, we shall not offer for sale certain goods, or restricted items to you (e.g. alcohol, tobacco, etc.). Any offer for any Goods made on the Platforms is void when it is prohibited by law.<br>

23.2 For orders cancelled before delivery, Grab N' Go will process a refund of any rider tip paid by you to the payment method used for the order. Refunds will require time to be processed by us, your credit card company and/or your bank.

23.3 Tips are not refundable once the order has been delivered by the rider.<br>
