<h2>An overview of the personal data we process<br></h2>
In this section you can find general information about the categories of personal data we process about you. For your understanding, personal data is information that directly identifies you (such as your name or photo picture) or enables us to indirectly identify you (for example, on the basis of a user ID linked with the personal information in your profile).<br>

You will find more detailed information on our processing activities below, in the next section. But our data processing activities on the platform can be summarized by reference the main categories of personal data:<br>

<h2>a. Profile data (master data)<br></h2>

This includes your name, email address, password, telephone number, delivery addresses, interests, age.<br>

Why do we process this category?<br>

This data is your master data, which we absolutely need for our services. Without an email address / telephone number and a password, you cannot create a profile. Together with your name, this is your master data. We need your age to ensure that you are not a minor.<br>

<h2>b. Delivery data<br></h2>

This includes your name, delivery address, phone number, order details and order ID. If you are using our on-demand Grab 'N Go rider service (“Grab 'N Go”), this will also include the sender’s and recipient’s (if not yourself) names, pickup / delivery address and contact details.<br>

<h2>Why do we process this category?<br></h2>

In accordance with the principle of data minimization, we only provide our riders, shops and restaurants (as the case may be) with the information that they need from you to prepare and deliver your order and otherwise provide services requested to you.<br>

<h2>c. Order history data<br></h2>

This includes your order history, selected shops or restaurants (as the case may be), invoices, order ID, comments on orders, information on payment method, delivery address, successful orders and cancelled orders<br>

<h2>Why do we process this category?<br></h2>

Each time you place an order, this information will be added to your profile. You can view all this information in your profile at any time. We will use this information to improve our services and optimize the platform for your interests.<br>

<h2>d. Location data<br></h2>

This includes your address, postcode, city, country and your device’s longitude and latitude.<br>

<h2>Why do we process this category?<br></h2>

We need these data to be able to deliver your orders (or enable the restaurant or shop you have ordered from to deliver it to you). We create the longitude and latitude automatically in order to be able to process your delivery address in our other linked systems, such as our Rider app, and to display your address to our riders or riders of restaurants.<br>

<h2>e. Device information and access data<br></h2>

This includes your device ID, device identification, operating system and corresponding version, time of access, configuration settings, and your IP address.<br>

<h2>Why do we process this category?<br></h2>

Each time you access our platform, this information is stored by us for technical reasons. We also use parts of this information to detect suspicious behaviour at an early stage and to protect our platform.<br>

<h2>f. Customer care data<br></h2>

This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, and your ID from any social media (if applicable).<br>

<h2>Why do we process this category?<br></h2>

If you contact us, we collect this data because we need to know who we are talking to and what we have been talking about so that we can help you with your reason for contacting us. This also applies if you leave comments on social media on our fan pages. We do not combine this data with your profile data on our platform, but we can still identify you by your social media ID.<br>

<h2>g. Marketing contact and communications data<br></h2>
Why do we process this category?<br>
If you would like to receive an email newsletter, an SMS, an instant message, or an in-app push notification from us, we need certain information to send you the messages.<br>
Instead of addressing you with "Hey You", we find it more customer friendly to address you with your name.<br>
This category of personal data is also used by us to contact you, for example, if a product cannot be delivered and we want to offer you an alternative instead.<br>
<h2>h. Payment data<br></h2>
This includes your payment method, and encrypted, pseudonymized credit card information<br>
Why do we process this category?<br>
We need this information to initiate your payments and assign them to the orders you have placed.<br>
We also need this data to store your payment information for future orders (if you give us your consent to do so).<br>
<h2>5. Our detailed processing activities and processing purposes<br></h2>
We process your personal data only in accordance with relevant data protection laws.<br>
We pay particular attention to the fact that all principles for the processing of personal data are taken into account.<br>
Therefore, we only process your data if this is lawful and you can reasonably expect it to be processed.<br>
In order to be able to offer you our services, the processing of your personal data is essential.<br>
You do provide us with some of this data proactively by entering them on your device.<br>
Other data we collect automatically when you are using our platforms.<br>
We process your personal data for the following purposes (“Purposes”):<br>
